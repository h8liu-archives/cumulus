0.4?
    - Include an example filter script, lbs-filter-gpg, for encrypting
      segment data as it is written.

0.3 [2007-08-10]
    - LOCAL DATABASE CHANGE: A checksums file is now written out along
      with the snapshot descriptor that contains checksums of segments
      used in a snapshot.  This will allow quick integrity checks of a
      snapshot, without needing to decompress or decrypt the segment
      files.  The local database schema was modified to store the
      checksums for segments.
    - Build dependence on libtar has been dropped.  All necessary
      support for writing TAR files is now directly included with the
      source.
    - The snapshot format is now documented, at least in part.  See
      format.txt.
    - Snapshots now include link count and inode number for files with
      multiple hard links, so that a restore program could determine
      which files should be hard linked on restore.  The reference
      restore.pl script does not use this.
    - Bugfix: Print a help message instead of crashing if no files are
      specified.
    - Bugfix: File descriptors of files being backed up were closed
      twice.  In some cases this might have led to an unrelated file
      being closed (if the file descriptor was quickly re-used).
    - Preview of a new lbs-util command for maintaining snapshots.
      Functionality is currently limited.

0.2.2 [2007-07-27]
    - Update reference restore.pl script to handle octal/hexadecimal
      (format change introduced in 0.2).
    - Better support for mixing multiple backup schemes: the statcache
      file is now per-scheme, so performance should be better in cases
      where multiple different backups (of different source directories)
      are made, all sharing the same local database directory.

0.2.1 [2007-07-20]
    - Bugfix: Do not print an error when only one directory is specified
      to back up.

0.2 [2007-07-20]
    - SNAPSHOT FORMAT CHANGE: Metadata logs in backups can now contain
      octal and hexadecimal values.  Old restore programs may not be
      able to read these new backups.  The reference restore.pl script
      has not yet been updated.
    - LOCAL DATABASE CHANGE: Backups may be assigned a name with the
      --scheme= command-line option, to allow different backup sets to
      be mixed in the same directory.  The database schema for the local
      database is changed.
    - Improved selection (inclusion/exclusion) of files to be included
      in a backup.
    - Device major/minor numbers are dumped for block and character
      devices.

0.1 [2007-07-14]
    - Initial release.
